# Knapsack Problem (Genetic Approach)
This project provides an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Knapsack Problem. The Genetic Algorithm is a heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection, providing a robust method for finding approximate solutions to complex optimization problems.
